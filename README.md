- [ ] Optional: Display additional attributes, stylize the items in item ListView

**_Notes:_**

Spent some time setting up the enviroment and went through all the slides, demo videos and tips, they were very helpful. Played around a bit with different layouts, found that it's more convenient to edit those layout xml directly.
Wish I had more time to work on this :cry: because learning Android application development is really fun :smiley:
