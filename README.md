Simple Todo App
=============

This is an Android demo application for creating, editing and saving a simple ToDo list.

**_Time spent:_** A couple of hours here and there due to busy work schedule, 1 day (~ 12 hours) spent in total.

**_Completed user stories:_**

- [x] Required: User can view a list of existing todo items
- [x] Required: User can add a new item to the todo list
- [x] Required: User can remove an item from the todo list
- [x] Requried: User can edit the text of an item in the existing todo list and save the changes (new)
- [x] Optional: User can undo-delete in certain time frame (default 5 seconds)

**_Work-in-progress:_**
- [ ] Optional: User can specify priority for items
- [ ] Optional: Tweak the style of the app and improve the UI

**_Here comes my todo list_** :sweat_smile:
- [ ] Optional: User can specify completion due dates for items
- [ ] Optional: Display additional attributes, stylize the items in item ListView
- [ ] Optional: Persist the todo app in SQLite instead of using a text file
- [ ] Optional: Use a DialogFragment instead of new Activity to support editing items
 
**_Notes:_**

Spent some time setting up the enviroment and went through all the slides, demo videos and tips, they were very helpful. Played around a bit with different layouts, found that it's more convenient to edit those layout xml directly.
Wish I had more time to work on this :cry: because learning Android application development is really fun :smiley:
